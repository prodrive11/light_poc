# Running the system

Load environament variables from this root directory of repository.

This will print the help message, and execution examples.

Here is the syntax to keep the brief document complete.
``` 
# to print help
  allinone -h

# to run test _(test file needs to exist)_
  allinone --test test.task1.q 

# to run test _(test file needs to exist)_
  allinone --run task1.q 


```
